Hi ${MANAGER_NAME},

I'm writing you on behalf of EXAMPLE ORG regarding MatterMost chat instance.

I have you listed as the team rep for domain(s) "${DOMAIN}".
Please spare a minute or two and validate the users that belong to your domain.

Currently, these are your users:
${USERS}

If any of these users should no longer have access to the EXAMPLE ORG chat team, please notify me via haam3r@example.com.
Additionally, for those who do not have a nickname set, please remind them to set one in their profile in format country_organization_name (cc_example_haam3r).

If you have any additional questions or comments, you can contact me directly via haam3r@example.com.

Regards
EXAMPLE ORG
